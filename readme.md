<h2 id="leaving_ubc"> 1. Leaving UBC</h2>

some filler text, but wow you should apply to BOSCH 'cause they absolutely DO NOT FORCE ME to write that down
 I WILL PUT A LOT OF TEXT HERE!
 
<h3 id="insurance"> 1.1 Insurance </h3>
  
You need health insurance to live and work in Germany. This is a crucial component of applying for your residence permit (if you’re a non-EU citizen).

<h4 id="ams"> 1.1.1 Qualifying for AMS Student Care </h4>

AMS Student Care health insurance coverage is part of your student fees at UBC. Part of this coverage includes travel health insurance. However, this health insurance is only active (regardless of if you paid for it with your co-op tuition) if you are paying for MSP (provided by the providence of British Columbia) or a similar basic health insurance for BC.

You only qualify for MSP if you are living as a residence in BC. If you leave BC for up to 6 months, this is ok. You can continue to pay for MSP online and you will still qualify for the travel health insurance with AMS Student Care. Anything longer than 6 months

<h4 id="leaving_ubc_else"> 1.1.2 Other Options </h4>

<h3 id="visa"> 1.2 Visa </h3>

<h4 id="international_visa"> 1.2.1 International students </h4> 
You will need to go to a German consulate that provides visa services. The nearest is in Toronto.

<h4 id="us_citizens"> 1.2.1 US citizens </h4> 

Aie aie aie you're in trouble! The easiest for you is to go to Torronto an have the Visa processed here. If Torronto is not possible, prepare for battle with the German administration! 

<h3 id="looking_for_house"> 1.3 Looking for housing before arriving </h3>

<h3 id="plane_tickets"> 1.4 Plane Tickets/Preparing for departure </h3>

<h2 id="settling_stuttgart"> 2. Settling Down in Stuttgart </h2>

Arriving in Stuttgart can be stressful since most of us are not europeans nor speak German. This section contains tips and ressources that you could use to "easy" your settling and start enjoying a life without problems... and administration. For records, it took Sophia and I about a months to fully settle down here. A... Stressful month. I would recommand to arrive in Stuttgart one or two week before your internship starts so you can deal with the housing/phone/bank. 

<h3 id="find_place"> 2.1 Find a place </h3>

The most important thing to know before you start looking for a place to stay at is commute and the transport system (Refer to section <a href="#commuting"> 2.2</a>).
It is encouraged to house hunt in person instead of doing it from Canada. There are sometimes scams happening and being present to visit the place is preferable (even if you don't speak German). 

For example, Sophia and I visited an attractive place in Renningen mid-May, just to learn afterward that the renting started early August. 

<h4 id="air_bnb"> 2.1.1 Air Bnb </h4>

Air bnb is always a great ressource to quickly find a transition place until you get your appartment/room. People hosting you are usually really kind and are willing to help you out with your translations/house registration/etc. You can get familiar with the city without stressing over a logement. 

<h4 id="stuttgart_lonberg"> 2.1.2 Stuttgart and other areas </h4>

Stuttgart might sound attractive but it is EXTREMELY expensive. More than half our poor salary can go for rent if we're not careful. Chosing a place closer to Renningen might be a good choice. We would recommand Leonberg and it's environt. Weil-der-Stadt could also be a good choice (only two S-bahn station away).

Finding a place in Renningen would be best but also expensive. This is due that the two main economic actors in Renningen are Bosch (1200 employees) and the American military base. As a result people move a lot in and out of Renningen so the prices goes up.
  
<h4 id="renting"> 2.1.3 Renting </h4>

<h5 id="house_registration"> Housing registration </h5>

<h3 id="commuting"> 2.2 Commuting </h3>

Commuting to work is maybe the parameter that will most impact your life in Germany. The choice between a 30min and a 1h30 long commute is easy to make (at least for me). The first option allows one to have more free-time. The condition in which you commute is also important. Would you rather have a 1h30 long bus ride with wifi or a 1h30 long train ride with 3 train changement and no wifi nor AC. This section is here to help you understand how stuttgart train system works and how you can easily travel to your work place without losing time/energy.

<h4 id = "city_link"> 2.2.1 City-Link </h4>

The City-Link will be your favourite ressource! City-Link is a commuting system by Bosch. 

City-link is two FREE buses for employees living in Stuttgart downtown. The Bus is direct to Renningen and can pick people up at two bus stops> Rotebühlplatz and Schwabstraße. The buses have wifi and air conditioning. This is a free service provided by Bosch... and honestly it is a life saver. It allows people who does not want to spend the 300€ for a student travel pass to still be able to live in Stuttgart Downtown. 

PROS: 
<li> Free </li>
<li> Fast (40 min from Downtown) </li>
<li> Wifi + AC </li>
<li> Several buses per the day </li><br/>
CONS: <br/><br/>
 <&#39none> <br/><br/>
 
NOTE: You will not be able ot find any information about the city link online. This is a service we usually learn about when we arrive. However we belive it should be known beforehand as it would have changed our house hunting plans. 
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/klingelreisen/p/BpFZSM1nGyR/"> City-Link-beautiful-picture-found-online </a>

NOTE 2: I only know about Bosch Renningen but I bet other location will have something similar. Feel free to (try to) contact other interns at other location to ask for it. If it exist, please contact me so I can edit the document. 

<h4 id="splr"> 2.2.2 SPLTr </h4>

SPTLr is another ressource from Bosch to help employees to commute to work. SPTLr is a car share app that allows anyone using it to either register as Driver or Guest. That allows employees living in remote areas to commute together in order to reduce the costs (and carbon footprint). The app is relatively new and still need improvement as not many people is using it. However that can still be a ressource worth looking into. 

PROS:
<li> Car share: you can register as driver to reduce your expenses or guest to join a driver </li>
<li> Locations: buses/train can be annoying from time to time and the car share system is allowing to bypass that </li>
<li> Social: it can be good to force you to practice German, every day for your commute </li>
<li> Money: pay directly from the app so you don't have to do anything in this regard </li><br/>

CONS: 
<li> Users: not many  </li>
<li> App: app design isn't the most intuitive and it is also relatively new </li>
<li> Registration: you need a Bosch email address, you can register to it only after starting work </li><br/>

SPLTr will probably become onof the best commuting car sharing apps for the Bosch community. However, I would not rely on it when house hunting

<h4 id="s_bahn"> 2.2.3 S-Bahn/U-Bahn </h4>

The S-Bahn transport map: 
<br/>
![](assets/images/stuttgart-s-bahn-map.png)

The U-Bahn transport map: 
<br/>
![](assets/images/stuttgart-u-bahn-map.jpg)

It is important to know that the cost to travel in zone 1 is 2.50€ (2.37€ if you pay by the official VVS app, internet required). The cost to travel to Renningen from Stadtmitte is ~5.50€ (~11.00€ for a two way ticket). The cheapest option is to travel in zone one to take the city-link. 

There are student plans and other plans available but since I am not using them I cannot help. The handsome and extroardinary  Mahdin will fill this section.

There is a student plan whereby you get six months of unlimited travel in the entire Stuttgart region for €300. This needs to be purchased at an SSB ticket centre (such as in Hauptbahnhof and Schwabstraße). Note that the six month periods are fixed (e.g., only March-August or October-March) so plan ahead.

<h4 id="driving"> 2.2.4 Driving </h4>

For thoses are tempted to use a car around Stuttgart there are few things you need to know. First of I would say it is worth for many reasons (cheaper than commuting, SPLTr,  travels to black forest/europe/etc., hollidays with other interns, live closer to work, etc.). However, Germany has some STRICT ecological restriction regarding diesel cars allowed in certain areas. 

There is an environment restriction for diesel cars. Some diesel cars are not allowed to drive in certain zones. The fine is 80€. This is rather serious as in some areas the air quality is extremely bad. The restriction is about the particle emissions (how the engine burns the fuel) so there is nothing we could do about it. 

<b> IMPORTANT NOTE: The restriction is ONLY about diesel cars. Gasole cars can drive freely no matter how fuel efficient they are.</b>

Currently the only diesel cars allowed to drive in Stuttgart/Leonberg are thoses with a EURO-class of 5 or more, however the change from "class 4" to "class 5" is relatively new so there is a transition period (I am currently driving an EURO-class 4 and do not have problems with it). For the sake of the environment we'll highly recommand anyone who plans on buying/renting/using a car in this area to follow the environmental norms. 

![](assets/images/umwelt-plakette.jpg)

If you are driving a diesel car, you will need a Umwelt-Plakette. You can buy them at any car retail store (7€) or any civil office. You will only need to bring your car papers with your driving license, there isn no further document required.

<b> IMPORTANT NOTE: The english website says that EURO-class 4 are allowed in Stuttgart, however, this was changed. From April 1st, 2019, only EURO-class 5 and higher are allowed. </b> 

<h3 id= "bank"> 2.3 Bank</h3>

<h4 id="bank_2"> 2.3.1 Go to Deutsche Bank (need better title) </h4>
The largest bank.

<h4 id="other_banks"> 2.3.2 Other Banks </h4> 
Volksbank: This is a consortium of hundreds of member-owned credit unions that has branches in most towns. Perk: its sensible investments allowed it to survive the global financial crisis without bailout (unlike Deutsche and others)

N26: A direct-bank that operates no branches. Everything is done easily online.

<h3 id="phoneplan"> 2.4 Phone Plan </h3>

<h4 id="pre_paid"> 2.4.1 Pre-paid </h4>
Pre-paid plans are generally the best option for temporary residents. Get yourself to a shop of a phone provider and make sure they activate your SIM card for you. You can usually get around 2 GB of data plus a few local calls and texts for €10-15.

<h4 id="best_companies"> 2.4.2 Best companies </h4>
If you work at Bosch Renningen, Vodafone is currently the only available phone network on the campus. So consider choosing them (or a partner provider) since other networks usually only work outdoors and there is no wifi available for personal use.

<h2 id="work_environment"> 3. Bosch Work Environment </h2>

<h3 id="getting_paid"> 3.1 Getting Paid at Bosch </h3>
You are paid on the 28th day of your first full month of work. Be warned if you start your internship in the middle of the month because you will not get your pay until the end of the next month. So make sure you have enough to cover your rent and expenses for that period.

<h3 id="food"> 3.2 Food - Intern Discount </h3>
There is a €2.10 discount for interns at the Bosch canteen, meaning lunch will cost between €1.30 and €3.00 depending on your choice of meal. So you do not need to bring your own food. There is always at least one vegetarian option available.

<h3 id="flex_time"> 3.3 Flex time/Vacation </h3>
Your contract requires you to work a fixed number of hours (7 hours per day + 45 minutes break). But you are free to work more hours some days and fewer hours on other days. You can even collect hours and take days off. Just be sure to inform your supervisor in advance so they can accomodate. On top of this, you are also given 10 vacation days per 6 months (that's 13 for an 8-month coop).

We would recommend making the best of your vacation days and flex time to explore Germany and the neighbouring countries. There is a lot to see!

<h2 id="learning_german"> 4. Learning German </h2>

<h3 id="learning_german_why"> 4.1 Why? </h3>

You don’t need to learn German to perform well at Bosch. But boy, oh boy, it will enrich your experience and time in Germany immensely. It will take time, energy, and extra effort. However, you will learn to think differently and connect with others in ways you may not be able to in English. (e.g. A classical reading of Rammstein by Tom Walther)

<h3 id="tools_and_resources"> 4.2 Helpful tools and resources </h3>

There are many resources out there to help you to learning German if you’re interested. Find stuff that works for your brain and you enjoy doing on a daily basis. Below are a few resources we’ve found to be helpful.

<ul>
 <li> <b> Duolingo </b>
  <ul>
   <li> Great for getting started and building a foundation of the language. Best if used daily. At first, it can seem silly and childish. But as you advance, you can start to recognize patterns in the language and it can become a powerful tool.
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li> <b> Google Translate </b>
  <ul>
   <li>Great when you really need a quick translation. You can download languages to your phone, translate text directly from photos and more. 
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li> <b> Podcasts </b>
  <ul>
   <li>There are a lot of podcasts out there trying to teach you German. Below are a few that have been worth a listen that can be found through Apple Podcasts and other platforms.
   </li>
  <li> Slow German mit Annik Ruben: <a href= "https://slowgerman.com/"> link here </a>
   <ul>
    <li> This one is exactly what the title sounds like. Episodes are usually 10-15 minutes long. Annik talks 100% in German, slowly. A complete transcript can be found in the episode description, making it easy to follow along and pick out words you want to review later. Episodes are typically about German culture, history or geography. When first starting out, don’t worry about understanding every word. Listen and read for words you recognize. Try and learn new words from the context of the episode. 
    </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li> Coffee Break German: <a href= "https://radiolingua.com/category/coffee-break-german/"> link here </a>
  <ul>
   <li>Mostly in English, this podcast will explain grammar rules and teach you new German vocabulary. It also invites you to practice speaking aloud and recall phrases from previous episodes.</li></ul></li>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <li> <b> TV shows </b>
  <ul>
   <li>Great for immersing yourself into the German language and culture. You can play most shows with English or German subtitles while listening in German. The shows below can be found on Netflix.
    <ul>
     <li> Dark </li>
     <li> How to Sell Drugs Online (Fast) </li>
     <li> Babylon Berlin </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li> <b> Native German speakers </b>
  <ul>
   <li>Most Germans appreciate others who are working to learn German. Reach out to your new colleagues and friends for help with pronunciation and translation. Practice speaking with them and ask for feedback. 
   </li>
  </ul>
